# discard
discard patience aka aces up aka kings patience

This is a simulation of discard patience. I wanted to get an idea of how often the game could be solved. There is no AI in this implementation. There is a small amount of skill in discard patience, so a human would get better results than this implementation. Run the game after importing discard with "discard.game()". For more verbose output "discard.game(verbose = True)". To run statistics use "discard.statistics(n)" where n is the number of runs.
